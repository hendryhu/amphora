To build, create a new openFrameworks project. This was tested with Visual Studio on Windows, but it should work on other platforms.

Then, replace the files in the `src/` directory with everything in the `src/` directory in this repo. Make sure to import the files using ("Add existing item") in Visual Studio, if not already done.

Then, Run/Debug.
